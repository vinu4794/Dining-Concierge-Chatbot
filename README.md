# Dining-Concierge-Chatbot
Team Project for course "CS-GY 9223: Introduction to Cloud Computing" (Group of Two).
This repository is forked from my team member's github repository, since we worked on the project together.

## Project Goal
Implement a serverless, microservice-driven web
application: Specifically, to build a Dining Concierge chatbot that sends you
restaurant suggestions given a set of preferences that you provide the chatbot with
through conversation.
